                Transparency and taxpayer accountability in APCC payments

            <div class="bulletin-text">
                The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) has 33 PCCs as members and is registered as a member’s club. A FOI Act request was sent to this organisation, all of whose 33 members are <b>public servants</b>, asking to see a copy of their full accounts. This request was refused.
                <br><br>
                The Information Commissioner’s Office upheld this, stating that under the FOI Act, a member’s club was not required to respond.
                <br><br>
                A FOI request was then sent to <b>Matthew Barber</b> asking how much he had paid over the past 5 years in membership fees to his members club, out of <b>taxpayers’ funds</b>. He responded with the following details:
            </div>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Year</th>
                    <th>Amount (£)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr><td>2021/22</td><td>33,387.54</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2022/23</td><td>2,000.00</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2023/24</td><td>41,762.79</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2024/25</td><td>51,500.00</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2025/25</td><td>52,445.00</td></tr>
            </table>

            <div class="bulletin-text">
                Considering the substantial nature of these payments, a FOI request was sent to <b>Matthew Barber</b> asking him to supply a copy of the full APCC accounts, as a member he would be issued with them annually to sign off, and he would want to know how <b>Thames Valley taxpayers’ money</b> was being spent. To date, he has refused to answer the request, but he did attend the National Rural Crime Network’s “Rural Crime Conference” this year. (The NRCN is a trading arm of the APCC.) It was held at the Institute of Directors in Pall Mall, described as a very rural, inexpensive, and centrally located setting, so many people could attend.

            <div class="conclusion-title">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="bulletin-text">
                For transparency, <b>Matthew Barber</b> should supply a copy of the full accounts of the APCC for the past 5 years, so <b>Thames Valley taxpayers</b> can see how their money is being accounted for. Otherwise, he should arrange for all membership fees to be returned for the use of the <b>Chief Constable of the Thames Valley</b> to employ more officers to investigate crime.

            <h3>Environmental Crime in South Oxfordshire</h3>
            <div class="bulletin-subtitle">"A quarter-million-pound landfill offence – still unprosecuted"</div>

            <div class="bulletin-text">
                An environmental crime in South Oxfordshire, visible on Google Earth, has not been prosecuted by either the Environment Agency or Oxford County Council. This is a case of <b>fly tipping</b>, which can range from shovelling mud into a stream, throwing rubbish from a car, to much larger illegal dumping operations occasionally reported in the media.
                <br><br>
                This illegal dumping would have generated approximately £¼ million in landfill tax, as it infilled the floodplain, where waste can be toxic and taxed at the highest rate. As a result, <b>residents of Cholsey</b> may face a higher risk of flooding this year.

            <h3>Police Waiting Lists</h3>
            <div class="bulletin-subtitle">"What the NHS counts daily — the police say they don't track"</div>

            <div class="bulletin-text">
                We have all heard of NHS waiting lists. It is a basic business performance indicator, and the NHS knows, on a shift-by-shift basis, how many beds will become available and how many patients are waiting.
                <br><br>
                <b>Matthew Hogg, Chief Constable of the Thames Valley</b>, claims not to know how many crimes have been reported for which no investigating officers are available. Yet, frontline officers often refer to very long waiting lists when challenged.
                <br><br>
                A national FOI survey will reveal the true extent of the pressure on frontline officers, summarised in <b>Police Waiting Lists</b>.
