        <h4 class="b-full-subtitle">Transparency and taxpayer accountability in APCC payments</h4>

        <p class="b-text">
            The <b>Association of Police and Crime Commissioners</b> has 33 PCCs as members and is registered 
            as a member’s club.<br><br>

            A FOI act request was sent to this organisation all of <b>who's 33 members are public servant</b> 
            asking to see a copy of their full accounts. This request was refused.<br><br>

            The <b>Information Commissioner’s Office</b> upheld this stating that under the FOI act a member’s 
            club was not required to respond.<br><br>

            A FOI request was sent to <b>Matthew Barber</b> asking how much he had paid over the past 5 years in 
            membership fees to his members club, out of taxpayers funds. He responded:<br><br>

            Considering the substantial nature of these payments a FOI request was sent to Matthew Barber 
            asking him to supply a copy of the full <b>APCC accounts</b> as, being a member, he would be issued 
            with them on an annual basis to sign off. He would want to know how 
            <b>Thames Valley taxpayers’ money was being spent</b>.<br><br>

            To date he has refused to answer the request but he did attend the National Rural Crime Network’s 
            <b>“Rural Crime conference”</b> this year. (The NRCN is a trading arm of the APCCs.) It was held at 
            …. wait for it .. the very rural and inexpensive, and centrally located .. setting of …. the 
            Institute of <b>Directors in Pall Mall</b>.

        <!-- CONCLUSIÓN -->
        <h3 class="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h3>

        <p class="b-text">
            In our opinion, for transparency <b>Matthew Barber</b> should supply a copy of the full accounts of 
            the APCC for the past 5 years so <b>Thames Valley taxpayers</b> can see how their money is being 
            accounted for. Otherwise, he should arrange for all membership fees to be returned for the use of 
            the <b>Chief Constable of the Thames Valley</b> to employ more officers to investigate crime.
