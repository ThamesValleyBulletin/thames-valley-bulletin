            This website aims to bring facts to the people of the <b>Thames Valley</b> without all the <b>conjecture</b>, <b>abuse</b>, <b>PCC crime washing</b> and <b>misinformation</b> that comes with social media. The <b>Freedom of Information Act</b>, used correctly, is a powerful tool that holds those spending taxpayer money to account.

            <h3>Matthew Barber, Police and Crime commissioner for the Thames Valley</h3>
            <h4>Transparency and taxpayer accountability in APCC payments</h4>
            <p><b>Association of Police and Crime Commissioners</b> has 33 PCCs as members and is registered as a member’s club. A FOI act request was sent to this organisation all of who's 33 members are <b>public servant</b> asking to see a copy of their full accounts. This request was refused. The <b>Information Commissioner’s Office</b> upheld this stating that under the FOI act a member’s club was not required to respond. A FOI request was sent to <b>Matthew Barber</b> asking how much he had paid over the past 5 years in membership fees to his members club, out of taxpayers funds. He responded:</p>

            <table>
                <tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount (£)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>2021/22</td><td>33,387.54</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2022/23</td><td>2,000.00</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2023/24</td><td>41,762.79</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2024/25</td><td>51,500.00</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2025/25</td><td>52,445.00</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>Considering the substantial nature of these payments a FOI request was sent to Matthew Barber asking him to supply a copy of the full APCC accounts as, being a member, he would be issued with them on an annual basis to sign off. He would want to know how Thames Valley taxpayers’ money was being spent. To date he has refused to answer the request but he did attend the National Rural Crime Network’s <b>“Rural Crime conference”</b> this year. It was held at …. wait for it .. the very rural and inexpensive, and centrally located .. setting of …. the <b>Directors in Pall Mall</b>.</p>

            <h3 class="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>In our opinion, for transparency <b>Matthew Barber</b> should supply a copy of the full accounts of the APCC for the past 5 years so <b>Thames Valley taxpayers</b> can see how their money is being accounted for. Otherwise, he should arrange for all membership fees to be returned for the use of the <b>Chief Constable of the Thames Valley</b> to employ more officers to investigate crime.</p>

            <h3>Environmental crime involving 250 lorries of landfill in South Oxfordshire</h3>
            <h4>Up next time, watch this space</h4>
            <p>Bulletin #2 will include a picture of an environmental crime involving an estimated 250 lorries of land fill, that has taken place in South Oxfordshire, can be clearly seen on Google Earth and which neither the Environment agency nor Oxford County Council have prosecuted. The crime is technically fly tipping, anything from shovelling mud into a stream to throwing a bottle out a car window to what has been seen this week in the news (20/11/2025). Yet it would have raised £1/4 million in landfill tax as it infilled the flood plain where all waste can be toxic so would have been at the highest rate and as a result residents of Cholsey may expect more flooding this year.</p>

            <h3>Police waiting lists analysis</h3>
            <h4>Up next time, watch this space</h4>
            <p>We have all heard of NHS waiting lists. It is a basic business performance indicator and the NHS knows on a shift basis how many beds will become available and how many patients we waiting. <b>Matthew Hogg Chief Constable of the Thames Valley</b> claims not to know how many crimes have been reported to which there are no investigating officers available to investigate them. Yet frontline officers refer to very long waiting lists when challenged. A national FOI survey will show the true extent of how stretched front-line officers are in a summary of Police Waiting lists.</p>
