<h1>Environmental Crime in the Thames Valley</h1>

<div class="subtitle">
"Illegal infilling of the Thames flood plain"
</div>

<img src="frontpage-bulletin-1.png" alt="Flood plain overview">

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The Environment Agency (EA)</b> were immediately notified and a
        <b>FOI Request (Freedom of Information)</b> asked if any permission to
        infill the flood plain had been granted.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The response was that <b>no permission was granted</b> (and never would be),
                meaning the land owners and the company supplying the waste have
                <b>illegally infilled the flood plain</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        The EA confirmed they visited the site and were told by the owners that
        only drainage ditches were being dredged, while neighbours reported
        <b>hundreds of lorries</b> coming and going over a <b>six-month period</b>.
        <ul>
            <li>Since then, the EA have done nothing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Cholsey Parish Council reported this to
        <b>Oxfordshire County Council (OCC)</b>, who have subsequently done nothing.
    </li>

    <li>
        The OCC were sent a FOI request at the end of 2025 but refuse to say
        what, if any, action they are taking.
    </li>

    <li>
        Had this infilling of the flood plain been carried out legally, it would
        have incurred approximately <b>£250,000 in landfill tax</b>, revenue that
        would have been a welcome contribution to the council’s budget.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The appropriate staff at Oxfordshire County Council responsible for
        prosecuting such blatant criminal activity must explain to the people of
        Oxfordshire what action is being taken and not hide behind the Freedom of
        Information Act.
